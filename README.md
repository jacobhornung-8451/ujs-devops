## Introduction

**Howdy!** ðŸ¤ 

This repository is meant to serve as a practical introduction into some of the basic concepts of DevOps and CI/CD using
an open-source (FREE) tech stack. We will try to cover broader strokes, however this will not be a
comprehensive view of everything that gets associated with the DevOps buzzword these days (that's a lot of stuff).

Regardless, hopefully this will be enough to pique your interest and point you in the direction of some good resources 
that you can look into as you see fit. 

## How it works 

We have 5 branches that contain different exercises that will cover different components of our stack:

- `0-code`: Writing our application that we want to deliver
- `1-build`: Building our desired artifact in a automated/repeatable manner 
- `2-deploy`: Deploying our code to a runtime environment so that others can access it
- `3-configure`: Configure our code so that we can deploy across multiple environments
- `4-monitor-maintain`: Monitor our code so that we can detect when issues arise and determine root cause, as well as how
to properly resolve the issue 
- `5-finale`: just a finalized branch that contains a base level solution using the lessons from the previous branches

The idea behind this exercise is that you: 
1. Start by forking this repository to a personal org
2. Checkout the branch `0-code` using `git checkout <branch-name>`  
3. Complete the exercises according to the instructions 
4. Move onto the next one (checking in changes if you'd like)


## Contributions/Feedback 

This is a new *implementation* of this exercise so there are bound to be some issues or areas of improvement. If you find
something unsavory/ineffective/cantankerous please feel free to create an issue.
